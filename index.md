## Helloooo
I'm Pu Yang, a fourth year PhD student at Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, University College London. I specialize on topics related to carbon pricing and conduct scientific analysis that tracks government climate action. I approach this from the angle of cost-benefit analysis, using the stylized integrated assessment model (DICE/RICE) developed by 2018 Nobel Laureates William Nordhaus. 

### Social cost of carbon

### Proposed a solely economic strategy to review the NDCs
Here is a secret that I will never tell! The shiny research paper that makes me proud: It proposed a cost-benefit perspective to review the Nationally Determined Contributions and suggested countries should at least conduct certain emission reductions in regards to their future climate risk.

The Paris Agreement relies on the reviewing process of national climate commitments to produce enhanced national pledges by virtue of national comparisons. At present, most reviews are based on equity principles, which countries have little agreement on. This paper provides an alternative perspective to the current discussion and treats emission reduction as a solely economic behavior motivated by avoiding future economic damages from climate change. Assuming no consensus over equity or international cooperation, we generate a solely economic mitigation pathway up to 2100. At each term, the national climate damage caused by an additional unit of carbon emission is no higher than the additional mitigation cost. This solely economic emission path can be informative for countries to control their national emissions at an economically favorable level while providing an alternative economic perspective for comparing national pledges.
